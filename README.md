# Creating complex solutions for simple problems since 2001! 

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As using a single one-purpose github account for work and private was causing too much input in the wrong timeframes, I decided to split up my account into multiple:

- My [fliphess](https://github.com/fliphess) account (this one), account which I will use for hobby stuff where the sun is always shining: home automation and other private, non-work-related projects.
- Work accounts on which I will receive the whole shebang of linux, security, kubernetes and other work-related notifications and all the like.

This is so I don't get all the work related notifications on my private github account when coding and searching github as a way to relax during weekends.

Most of my recemt projects can be found in the [flapperdeflipper](https://github.com/flapperdeflipper) organization.

As github more and more is becoming this super annoying company and most issues in projects that you think are related to the issue you are looking for are automagically declared stale and closed without a solution or any response in there, I'm not using github as much anymore.
